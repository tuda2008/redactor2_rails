      //= require redactor

Add to your `application.css`:

      *= require redactor

### Initialize Redactor

For each textarea that you want to use with Redactor, 
add the "redactor" class and ensure it has a unique ID:

    <%= text_area_tag :editor, "", :class => "redactor", :rows => 40, :cols => 120 %>
    
You need to put your textarea inside the form with `authenticity_token` field.

### Custom Your redactor

If you need change some config in redactor, you can

    $ rails generate redactor2:config

Then generate `app/assets/javascripts/redactor2_rails/config.js`.

See the [Redactor Documentation](http://imperavi.com/redactor/docs/settings/) for a full list of configuration options.


If You Want To setup a new language in Redactor you should do three things:

In you file `app/assets/javascripts/redactor2_rails/config.js` set option

    "lang":'ru'

Place lang files in the following location:
   
    `app/assets/javascripts/langs/`

and

Add to your `application.js`:

    //= require langs/ru

#### Setting a max image size with carrierwave

If you want to set a maximum image size used when a user uploads an image via carrierwave, open the uploader file and add add the following:

    # app/uploaders/redactor2_rails_picture_uploader.rb:33

    process :resize_to_limit => [500, -1]

The above example will set the image to have a maximum width of 500px.

### Using plugins

After including the desired plugins they can be configured in the redactor config file as normal.

To add it into the editor add 'plugins' attributes to config.js file and specify which ones do you want to use:
  $R('.redactor', { 
        plugins: ['video', 'fullscreen', 'textdirection', 'clips'],
        lang:'zh_cn' }
  );
  $('.redactor').redactor();

Full details of these can be found at [Redactor Plugins](http://imperavi.com/redactor/plugins/)

### Defining a Devise User Model

By default redactor2_rails uses the `User` model.

You may use a different model by:

1. Run a migration to update the user_id column in the
2. Overriding the user class in an initializer.
3. Overriding the authentication helpers in your controller.

Create a new Migration: `rails g rename_user_id_to_new_user_id`

    # db/migrate/...rename_user_id_to_new_user_id.rb

    class RenameUserIdToNewUserId < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def up
        rename_column :redactor2_assets, :user_id, :admin_user_id
      end

      def down
        rename_column :redactor2_assets, :admin_user_id, :user_id
      end
    end

    # config/initializers/redactor2.rb
    # Overrides the user class

    module RedactorRails
      def self.devise_user
        %s(admin_user) # name of your user class
      end

      # You may override this to support legacy schema.
      # def self.devise_user_key
      #   "#{self.devise_user.to_s}_id".to_sym
      # end
    end

    # app/controllers/application_controller.rb

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      ...

      def redactor2_authenticate_user!
        authenticate_admin_user! # devise before_filter
      end

      def redactor2_current_user
        current_admin_user # devise user helper
      end
    end
